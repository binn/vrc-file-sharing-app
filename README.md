# VRC File Sharing App

This was the source code for a community file sharing tool for VRChat avatars, worlds, and etc. Unity-made content could be shared or ripped from the game and be used for free by other VRChat players.
This website is no longer up, however I have left the codebase public to show my portfolio.

This was developed with .NET 7 and uses several technologies such as EF Core, AutoMapper, and Docker.
